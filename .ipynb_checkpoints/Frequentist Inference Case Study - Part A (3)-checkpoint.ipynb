    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma_{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_{mean}$ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population (the population parameter)."

    "This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample. From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, now that we've taken one sample of size $n$ and made some claims about the general population, what if we were to take another sample of size $n$? Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population? This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_\n",
    "\n",

    "Now, the standard normal distribution (with its variance equal to its standard deviation of one) would not be a great illustration of a key point. Instead, let's imagine we live in a town of 50,000 people and we know the height of everyone in this town. We will have 50,000 numbers that tell us everything about our population. We'll simulate these numbers now and put ourselves in one particular town, called 'town 47', where the population mean height is 172 cm and population standard deviation is 5 cm."
